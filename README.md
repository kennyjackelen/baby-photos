# baby-photos

The goal of this project was to take a shared Google Drive directory for me and my wife to place photos of our daughter and generate a gallery page of those photos for friends and family to view.

Built on node.js, it uses Google APIs to retrieve the photos from Google Drive, and uses Express and Handlebars to render the page.
